Install an Editor
-----------------
I will be using Windows 10 for this class. I am using Visual Studio. To reformat
a paragraph in Visual studio you need to download an extension on the visual
studio marketplace. The one I chose will reflow whatever I highlight when I
press Ctrl K,Q 


Install a Compiler
-------------------
I downloaded gcc for my compiler. The output is c++: fatal error : no input files
compilation terminated.



A Program with Output
----------------------

Lab 2, The World's Smallest C++ Program
Author : Alex Benko
Editor used: Visual Studio
Compiler used: GCC
File: lab2.cpp
Compiled: Sep  4 2018 at 18:17:48


More Programs with Output
--------------------------
output-1:
Hello, World!

output-2: 
Hello, World!

output-3:
Hello, World!

output-4:
Hello, World!
Ending...

output-5:
Ending...

output-6:
Hello

output-7:
5 > 6 = 0
6 > 5 = 1
Then certainly 5 is not equal to 6 correct?  Correct!

output-8:
5 > 6 = 0
6 > 5 = 1
Then certainly 5 is not equal to 6 correct?  Right again! :)

output-9:
Hi
Hi, again...
Hi, again...

output-10:
why in the world would you do that!


Breaking Code
--------------
When capitlizing the "i" in "int", I was returned with an error "that does not name a type
 Int main()
 ^.".

When I capitlized the "m" in "main, I was given a crazy error ; C:/TDM-GCC-64/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/5.1.0/../../../../x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/../lib/libmingw32.a(lib64_libmingw32_a-crt0_c.o): In function `main':
C:/crossdev/src/mingw-w64-v4-git/mingw-w64-crt/crt/crt0_c.c:18: undefined reference to `WinMain'
collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Adding extra lines or spaces did not break the code though.

Having no spaces in the code returned the big error as well.

Indenting had no effect on the code. Indenting is used to make sure another human can follow what the code is trying to do. It makes it look good as well

Changing the name of the source file had no effect on the code what so ever. The name of the source file is only for the humans to keep track of what each source code file is.
